Building Instructions:

	Execute the following commands in a terminal 
	
	Compile:
	$ make clean
	$ make depend
	$ make
	
        These two executables are created after compiling
	    -> client
	    -> server


Execute:

    -> Server code syntax:
		
	./server 
		
    -> Client code syntax:

	./client 


NOTE : if server and client are going to be executed in two different systems , run the above commands in both the systems. Also change the ip address to the ip address of the server system in client.c code file. If both are going to be in the same system , change ip address in client.c to 127.0.0.1
